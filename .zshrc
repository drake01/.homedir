# CUSTOM ALIASES AND FUNCTIONS

# If ^C is pressed while typing a command, add it to the history so it can be
# easily retrieved later and then abort like ^C normally does. This is useful
# when I want to abort an command to do something in between and then finish
# typing the command.
#
# Thanks to Vadim Zeitlin <vz-zsh@zeitlins.org> for a fix (--) so lines
# starting with - don't cause errors; and to Nadav Har'El
# <nyh@math.technion.ac.il> for a fix (-r) to handle whitespace/quotes
# correctly, both on the Zsh mailing list.
